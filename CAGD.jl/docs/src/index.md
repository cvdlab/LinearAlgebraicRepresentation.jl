# Computational Solid Geometry

*A solid modeler for Julia.*

A package for building 2D/3D solid models by Boolean combination of solid primitives.

!!! note

    Please read through the
    [LAR Documentation](https://github.com/cvdlab/LinearAlgebraicRepresentation.jl/) section
    of the LAR modeling pages if this is your first time using LAR software. Then come back here.
    
    Note that the above must be updated to address the *Model* concept introduced here.

## Package Features

- Algebraic approach to computate Boolean operations between solid models 
- Boolean forms evaluated assembling atoms of finite algebra generated by ``E^d`` arrangement of solid terms. 
- Atoms (irreducible 3-cells) give a basis of the linear chain space associated with this partition.
- Basic linear algebra and algebraic topology is used, namely sparse matrices of linear operators.
- Validity of topology computations is guaranteed.
- CSG expressions of arbitrary complexity evaluated by a novel efficient process.
- CSG forms of any complexity traduced to `BitArrays` array, evaluated by vectorized logical operations. 
- Distinction is removed between manifold and non-manifold models.
- Simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) under development via Julia macros.
