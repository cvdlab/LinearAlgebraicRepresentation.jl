taking full advantage of computers in automating design and

complexes have been proposed as a uniform computational means
of representing physical objects, systems and properties. This
article introduces Chains, a computer language whose basic
datatypes are cells, cell complexes, and k-chains. To
illustrate how Chains may be used in numerical computing, we
develop a two page Chains program that completely specifies a
finite element solution to plane strain, including symbolic
definition of quadratic shape functions, the related “element
stiffness matrices”, and an algebraic-topological
specification of the assembly process. In contrast to a
textbook derivation of the finite element method (which it
closely resembles), this program is a fully formal finite
element computation, and hence is a step towards the goal of
improving the process of creating software for scientific
computing by raising the semantic level at which physical
systems are specified.},

geometric structures that are popular for interpolation and
mesh generation because they respect the shapes of planar
domains, they have ``nicely shaped'' triangles that optimize
several criteria, and they are easy to construct and update.
The present work generalizes constrained Delaunay
triangulations (CDTs) to higher dimensions and describes
constrained variants of regular triangulations, here
christened weighted CDTs and constrained regular
triangulations. CDTs and weighted CDTs are powerful and
practical models of geometric domains, especially in two and
three dimensions.},
